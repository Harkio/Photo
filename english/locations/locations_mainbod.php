    <h1>Glendalough</h1>
    <p> Glenndalough really is a fantastic location to practice photography. Glendalough is located in North Wicklow about an hours drive from Dubin. There are a number of praviate bus companies that will bring you out there for a day.
Glendalough, or the Glen of two Lakes, is one of the most important sites of maonastic ruins in Ireland. It is also known as the city of the seven Churches. Fourteen centuries have passed since the death of its founder, St. Kevin, when the valley was part of Ireland's Golden Age.
The two lakes, which gave the valley its name, came into existence thousands of years ago, after the Ice Age, when great deposits of earth and stone were strewn across the valley in the area where the Round Tower now exists. The mountain streams eventually formed a large lake. The Pollanass river spread alluvial deposits across the centre of the lake and created a divide to form the Upper and Lower Lakes. The Glenealo river flows in from the West into the Upper lake which is the larger and deepest of the two lakes.
Before the arrival of St. Kevin this valley (glen) would have been desolate and remote. It must have been ideal for St Kevin as a retreat and area to be 'away from it all'. Kevin died in 617 A.D. at the age of 120 years and his name and life's work is forever entwine with the ruins and the Glendalough Valley.

   <p style="text-align: center">This is an image of a footbridge over the Glendesan river.  By using a torch or even a smartphone light you can generate interest in the foreground.The lights of Dublin city can be seen to give an orange glow to the sky on the left and the moon creates a white effect on the clouds on the right. Both work well in silhouetting the mountains. </p>

    <p style="text-align: center">The medieval graveyard in Glendalough is great for playing with light. It is very close to the car park so you do not need to trek far. In this image the torch of an Iphonr 4s created a lighting effect to bring out the forground.The streetlamps created an orange glow on the right.  </p>

    <p style="text-align: center">This long exposure was captured using a canon flash on a remote trigger which spread the light over more graves than the phone but with a lower intesity. The hotel lights through the trees really create an eerie effect. This is was about 30 seconds.  </p>

   <p style="text-align: center">This is a composite image of two shots of the upper lake at Glendalough. One under exposed image captured the skyline while another overexposed image captured the foreground detail. Both shots were about 200 seconds with the aid of an ND filter, this created the movement effect in the clouds. Both images were then overlayed in photoshop to create the final composite.  </p>
