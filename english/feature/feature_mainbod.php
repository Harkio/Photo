    <h3>Q1. What kind of gear do you use?</h3>

    <p>Camera body – Canon eos 1100D
      Lens – I use three sigma lenses, in order of usage: 10-20mm, 35-70mm and 70-200mm
      Tripod – Manfrotto MKC3-H01 Compact Tripod. 
      Filters – I have uv filters on two lenses; but don't think they do much
      Flash – I currently don't use an external flash, but it's next on my list!
      Camera bag – I've borrowed a lowerpro backpack from a friend...it is also on my list.
      Mention others, if any: Trigger – Hahnel remote shutter release </p>

    <h3>Q2. Which is your favorite lens? Why?</h3>

<p>I think the three lenses I have all serve a purpose, and all help capture different photos depending on subject / time of day and lighting. But my favourite lens is currently the 10-20mm as I have primarily been taking long exposure landscape shots at night and it really helps frame the scenes; allowing me to capture the entire landscape / seascape / skyline; a tighter lens sometimes sacrifices the scene for the subject. It also gives a really nice feel to portrait shots; again I like being able to capture a scene –  more than just getting the face or body but including the room and all the activity that might be happening. Shooting in raw files means I can edit / crop the images as and how I need – but it works best to start with more in the image than is needed, and for this the wide-angle (but not fish-eye) works best.</p>



<h3>Q3. When you go in one of your travels, what all you take with you? Why?</h3>

<p>All things considered I do not have much gear, so I tend to bring everything I have just in case something catches my eye. The Lowerpro case has protective compartments for all the lenses and the body; as well as pouches and pockets for the trigger and other miscellaneous items such as spare battery/sd cards/lens caps/filters. With that on my back and the tripod in my hand I'm good to go.It's not too cumbersome and I like knowing that I have all the lenses; they all got used in my latest trip to NY, although I did miss not having the tripod – so when I finally get my own Lowerpro I will get one I can attach it to. Going out in the wee hours in Ireland means I normally bring gloves/scarf/jumper too; but I seemingly always forget to bring a flask  tea.</p>

<h3>Q4. Among the gadgets that you own, is there something that you wish you hadn not bought? Why?</h3>

<p>I have not made any pointless purchases yet. I started small and built up my lens and gadget collection slowly. I borrowed and tried a lot of gear before buying my own versions. I suppose I am still not utterly convinced that the uv filters are necessary; but they came free and already attached on two of my lenses. They don not annoy me enough to take them off, but I also do not really think they are worth it. I did get a wireless remote trigger that just would not sync with my camera – but it too was free, so I can not complain too vehemently about it. </p>

<h3>Q5. In the field, what are your settings?</h3>

<p>This is an incredibly subjective question, as it really depends on a lot of factors including primarily what it is you are taking the photograph of. I will summarise; I only shoot in raw these days (in case Iwant to try using Photoshop), try to use manual when I can (but sometimes cheat and use auto) and I tend to take a lot of photos with varying apertures/ISO/shutter speed to get what I want from the picture. The beneficial thing (problem?) of digital photography is the fact that you can take dozens of pictures of certain scenes and then pick your favourite ones.
  Aperture – 
  Shutter Speed – 
  ISO – 
  White Balance – 
  Focus – Manual/Auto 
  Image Format – RAW/JPEG </p>

<h3>Q6. What kind of tools do you use for post processing? Explain your work flow.</h3>

<p>I have Photoshop but really dont use it all that much. I have a fundamental problem with the idea of Photoshop as I think after editing for a while, you might as well just get good at digital painting. A lot is lost in photography if you can alter/change everything and add/delete features as needed. I have used it twice on my photos – one photo I had overexposed, and in another I did remove one of the birds that was cluttering the shot – so maybe if I learn how to use PS properly my opinion will change. As it stands I straighten / crop as needed and put some into sepia or monochrome</p>

<h3>Q7. How do you educate yourself to take better pictures</h3>

<p>I have a few books that I tend to dip in and out of, namely Scott Kelbys guides to digital photography; and the internet is a valuable tool, particularly youtube clips, that I really should use more. But my education, for lack of a better term, comes mainly from experience. Taking the camera up a mountain and coming back with no good photos but an understanding of why they didnt work is infinitely better than learning which settings should be used in any given situation. Not capturing a moment makes you look out for and anticipate the next one. By taking lots of photos, your eye for the shot improves considerably.
  
  Learn by doing, talk to other photographers and play is practice. </p>

<h3>Q8. Among your works, which one is your favorite? Why?</h3>

<p>I have been uploading a photo a day, in the guise of a 365; it is forcing me to take a lot of different types of photos, but means I now find it difficult to pick a favourite with 114 taken and counting. I like one I took of a puddle reflecting the lights from Times Square, I like the one I took of Newgrange, and I like a monochrome gravesite. My favourite is probably one that is not published anywhere online though, and it is one I have of my nephew pulling himself up for the first time. It was one of those pictures when I captured a moment in time with all the right settings. It's not the most exciting, or colourful, or interesting photos I've ever taken, but it would rank as one of my favorites.</p>

<a name="influences">

<h3>Q9. Whose work has influenced you most?</h3>

<p>Before I took photos myself (I only really started two and a half years ago) I had subscribed to the National Geographic magazine, and they were a massive influence. I would not be able to name names, but as a collective grou of photograhers I find them unparalleled. Once again I feel exposed as a fraud when this question is posed. I enjoy going to photography exhibitions, but they very rarely encapsulate or capture stories in the way that the NatGeo does. The last two exhibitions I went to were To Leave a Light Impression by Darren Almond, which were long exposures using nothing but moonlight, and an exhibitio in NY of Lewis Hines photography looking at immigration, social inequality and who could be thought of as a pioneer of documentary photography. I also enjoy the Wildlife Photography Exhibition held by Natural History Museum in London every year. The more I get into the art myself, the more I find I appreciate others; but for influence I would have to stick with the collective of National Geographic photographers.</p>

<h3>Q10. What is the one thing you wish you knew when you started taking photos?</h3>

<p>I wish I had known that it was possible to replicate the shots I liked sooner. For quite a while I would see a photo and be impressed with how they captured the star trail or how they made water look like mist or how they captured a certain image in a specific way; but now I have peeked behind the curtain to some extent and know some of the techniques I can try to replicate what I like. I can now craft and frame images with an idea of what they will look like as the finished article, where before there was am element shoot-and-pray. I still have a long ways to go yet, but I think if I had started sooner and learned by doing from a younger age I would have found my passion a lot sooner. On a more practical level, I wish I had bought a trigger sooner! I spent far too long holding down the shutter with one hand while trying to be still as a statue to keep the clarity and focus of the picture intact. Needless to say I failed. There is a marked difference between my photos from last year and my photos from last week; and that is from the accrued knowledge and assembly of a photography kit. </p>
