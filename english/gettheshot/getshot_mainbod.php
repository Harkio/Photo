    <h3 align="left">Weather </h3>
    <p>The weather conditions are an important thing to consider when planning to head out taking photos. The weather is particularal important when you are considering landscape photography. An overcast day will usually result in dull colours howevever if you are shooting in black and white for example, low clouds and mist can really make for atmospheric images.The same location on a bright sunny day will result in a completely different image. Have a look at the weather conditions and fit the image you plan to take accordingly. This can mean being flexible with your availability especially with Irish weather. I have left Dublin on a clear night to take skyscapes in Glendalough only to arrive and find the location overcast and dark.Also be aware of the temperarture. Cold can negativaly affect the battery life of cameras but also you will find that if you have not dressed for cold weather your images will suffer. I find that when I am freezing cold I rush the composition and the camera settings and come home with images Im not happy with resulting in a wasted day. </p>
    <p>Below you will see two images taken on different days from the same location. One is overcast and the other is clear. While the time and location are the same the mood in these images is very different. Think about the mood you want to capture and use the weather to your advantage.</p>

    <p> This may seem straigh forward but never go taking photos on an empty stomach. This will lead you to rushing your images and resulting in photographs that you probably wont be happy with. A great time to carboload is between long exposures. When your camera shutter is open for 5+ minutes you often find yourself doing the "night time shuffle" to try and keep warm. A sandwich and a flask of tea can be a lifesaver here. Plan ahead if you are heading out to take shots. </p>

    <h3 align="left">Safety </h3>
    <p>This may sound like common sense but you really need to take your safety into account when out snapping photos. Alway be sure you have a full battery in your phone, petrol in your car and money in your pocket. Let someone know where you are going. Some of the best shots can be taken in remote places but in order to make your image different than the thousands before it you generally need to go at a time that most people wouldnt. For example I have seen loads of shots of the Dublin docklands during the day and I though to myself that I hadnt seen very many during the night. A long lovely exposure of the city from the east link bridge will be sure to get a few likes on facebook.The city become steadily more deserted after Samuel Beckett bridge but I pushed on. Setting up my tripod on the toll bridge I was heckled and hassled by people passing along while other were eyeing up the camera. With no one else around I grabbed a quick sub par image and tore off back up the quays towards civilisation. "Thats why there are no images of the liffey from this angle at night"  I thought to myself.</p>
    <p align="left"> Be aware of the cost of your equipment. A Canon 6D retails at 1699.99 euro and people are aware of the price of these products. Be safe with yourself and your equipment. Unlike me do not risk yourself to get an image for a few facebook likes. </p>

    <h3 align="left">Time of Day </h3>
    <p align="left">The time of day can play a really important role in the images you take. Personally I much prefer getting out late at night and taking shots with starts or star trails than I would taking photos during the day. </p>
