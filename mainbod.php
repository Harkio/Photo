     <p> This month our top location is Glendalough. There is lots to get photographs to get here and lots of different environments to play with. The lakes are a famous location to photograph at any time of the day. The sky is open and there is very little light pollution so star trails and even milky way shots are possible. There is also an abundance of old mining equipment that make for great content.</p>
